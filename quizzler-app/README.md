# Quizzler App (Reload)

Project from section 32 of [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).

## Description

Upgrade of the Quiz App from section 17:

- new GUI with the _tkinter_ module - the previous version had no GUI
- the questions database is now fetched from the [open trivia database](https://opentdb.com/) with _requests_ module - in the previous app we just copied the JSON generated on the API page of the open trivia database website

## Online

You can check the app online [here](https://replit.com/@552020/Quizzler-App-Reloaded#main.py). Just press 'Run' (after you clicked on the link).

The quiz window is just roughly rendered on Repl.it but you will get an idea of what's going on.
